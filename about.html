                <h2>I</h2> <h3>am</h3> a software engineer living in Kansas City, MO. After attending a year in mechatronics engineering, I got the opportunity to become a professional boxer and moved to LA to pursue my athletic goal. I competed for almost 10 years.</h2>
                <br>
                During my time as an athlete I would read news on tech and started to become interested in learning how to code. I read a few books but then my path in coding got temporarilly stalled because I had to focus on work.After working as a tech support for different companies, I found Thinkful and decided to become a student of their bootcamp and become a paid programmer.
                <br>
                <p>I enjoy working with people, specially those with an interest in tech and coding. If you are looking to hire a new developer please reach out!</p>
